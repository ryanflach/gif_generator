# GifGenerator
Simple website built in rails that utilizes the Giphy API.

An admin has the ability to create new categories and add GIFs from the Giphy API to those categories. A default user has the ability to mark gifs as favorites, unfavorite GIFs previously marked as favorites, and view their collection of favorited GIFs sorted by category.

When a new user is created, they will receive an e-mail confirmation.
